# Mapping the Structure of the Milky Way

A large ground-based telescope in Chile took images of the night sky in the southern hemisphere and stored the data in data-cubes.

My task was to create a large-scale map of the dust within the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy in this region of the night sky. The large complex dataset would then be visually inspected to determine whether a previous theory concerning the number of arms and their positions was correct.

Using aplpy and matplotlib, the cubes were stitched together the large-scale map produced. Upon visual inspection, the theory was validated and a potential addition to an existing spiral arm was discovered.
