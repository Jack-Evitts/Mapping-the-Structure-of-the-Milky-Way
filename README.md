A large ground-based telescope, situated in the Atacama desert in Chile took images of the night sky in the southern hemisphere, collecting data to analyse the structure and composition of our own Milky Way galaxy.

Using python, my task was to convert the complex data-set into a visual map of the dust within our galaxy's spiral arms. Comparing the findings to literature, the structure and location of the spiral arms could be analysed to validate previous theories on the topic. My research indicated a potentially undiscovered addition to one of the spiral arms seen in the above image, linking boxes C and E.
